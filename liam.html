    <p>After One Direction's disbandment, Liam announced that he was signing with Republic Records. Then, in May of 2017, his debut solo single "Strip That Down", featuring Quavo and co-written with Ed Sheeran and Steve Mac, was released. The song was an overnight success. It immediately reached number ten on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the UK Singles Chart. Liam later released the single "Bedroom Floor" and a collaboration with Zedd, "Get Low"[9]. In 2018, Liam released his first extended play (EP), First Time, which featured a collaboration with French Montana. Unfortunately, this EP was met with mixed and negative reviews. Prior to the EP's release, Liam had announced that he was putting off the album so he could make some adjustments to it. In addition that that, Liam contributed vocals on Jonas Blue's song "Polaroid", along with Lennon Stella, released in October of that same year [9]. Consequently, in 2019, Liam released the song "Stack It Up", featuring American rapper A Boogie wit da Hoodie. In April 2020, he collaborated with Alesso and released the song "Midnight" to positive reviews [9].

    <p>In January 2020, Liam starred in the Hugo Boss fragrance campaign for their perfume Hugo Now. In May of 2020, he released his second capsule collection with Hugo Boss [1]. The collection consists mainly of men's wardrobes, polo shirts, T-shirts, shorts, hoodies, sweatpants and a pair of sneakers [9]. Liam then went on to become the first global brand ambassador for German brand Hugo Boss [9]. In addition to his musical and financial endeavors, Liam also became father to Bear Payne with ex-girlfriend Cheryl Cole.</p>
