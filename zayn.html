    <p>Zayn, being the first to leave One Direction in 2015, released 
his first solo studio album, Mind of Mine, a year later. Opposite to the pop-music he had made while in the band, much of Zayn's discography is R&B. To little surprise, Mind of Mine debuted at number one in a number of countries (i.e., the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United States). In addition, Zayn became the first British male solo artist to debut at number one with his first album. Zayn is also the first UK male artist to debut at number one in both the UK and US. Ironically enough, he also surpassed One Direction's number-two peak on the chart [3].

    <p>In April of 2018, Zayn released his second studio album, Icarus Falls. It contains 27 tracks including six previous singles he had already released. The album was received relatively-well, but not as well as Mind of Mine. Icarus Falls ranked 61 on the US Billboard 200 and 77 on the UK Albums Chart. On 28 August 2020, he re-released the album, including "Still Got Time" and "Dusk Till Dawn" [3].

    <p>Consequently, in September of 2020, Zayn released the single "Better", which serves as the lead single from his third studio album Nobody Is Listening [3]. The single marked the end of his two-year hiatus since releasing Icarus Falls. Zayn went on to describe the album as "his most personal project to date" [3]. Eventually, the album was released in January of 2021. In addition to this project, Zayn welcomed his child Khai Hadid Malik with supermodel and partner, Gigi Hadid.</p>
