    <p>In December of 2016, after One Direction's disbandment, Louis released a collaboration titled "Just Hold On" with DJ Steve Aoki. The song was incredibly well-received due to the song's hidden meaning. Despite the music video being two teenagers time-traveling and traveling the world, Louis had dedicated the song to his mother, who had passed. The single debuted and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart and reached number one on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Digital Song Sales chart [2].</p>

    <p>In July of 2017, Louis released the single "Back to You" featuring Bebe Rexha and Digital Farm Animals. The song peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Then, in October of that same year, he released a promotional single "Just Like You" which peaked at 99 on UK Official Charts [2]. That same year, Louis welcomed his son Freddie with hairstylist Briana Jungwirth [1]. Finally, in January of 2020, Louis released his debut solo album Walls. The album debuted at number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and number 9 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it the first new album for Arista Records in almost nine years to hit the top 10 on the chart [2].</p>
