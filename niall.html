    <p>Niall, being the first one from One Direction's disbandment to release a song, is an extremely talented guitarist. In September of 2016, Niall released "This Town" (a single from his debut album, Flicker) as an acoustic cover. The song remained a secret until its upload on YouTube. Then, a month later, Niall released the rest of his Flicker album through Neon Haze Music and Capitol Records. On the Billboard 200 chart, Flicker debuted at number 1 with 152,000 units, making it Niall's first number one album in the United States as a solo artist [6]. The album was incredibly well-received. That same year, Niall released "Finally Free" for the movie soundtrack of the animated film "Smallfoot" [1].</p>
    
    <p>Toward the end of 2019, Niall released a few new singles including "Nice to Meet Ya" and "Put a Little Love on Me" [1]. Then, in March of 2020, Niall released his second studio album, Heartbreak Weather. It was released through Capitol Records, three years after its predecessor Flicker [7]. On the Billboard 200 chart, Heartbreak Weather debuted at number 4 with 60,700 units, making it Niall's second top-10 album in the United States. The album debuted also at number 1 in Irish and UK charts [7]. Since then, he's also released a track with singer-songwriter Julia Michaels titled "What a Time" [1].</p>
